## Research Scope

My scientific work spans a broad multidisciplinary spectrum, including:

- Life Sciences: Biology, human physiology, animal breeding, and selection (Animal Science).
- Social & Behavioral Sciences: Psychology, sociology, sexology, and zoopsychology.
- Evolutionary Studies: Anthropology, ancient history, and human evolution.
- Prehistoric Technologies: Early Homo pre-fire (non-pyrotechnic) technologies, including non-thermal food processing, toolmaking, and proto-cultural behaviors.
- Linguistics: Archaeolinguistics, etymology, and prehistoric Proto-Indo-European communication.
- Computational Science: Analysis of AI reasoning methodologies, informatics, and the development of audiovisual encyclopedic content.
- Philosophy: Metaphysics and philosophical analysis.  

This wide-ranging perspective allows me to explore the intersections between biological, cultural, linguistic, and technological evolution.

## DOI Accessibility & Open Science Statement

Some of my earlier research outputs were originally deposited on Figshare. In 2025, Figshare unilaterally applied access restrictions to several items—including materials with assigned DOIs—despite these works being published under open licenses (CC BY 4.0).

These restrictions were not caused by any violation of terms or actions on my part. As a result, certain DOI landing pages may currently appear inaccessible or empty.

To ensure long-term accessibility and adherence to FAIR principles, I have migrated my research materials to community-driven, non-commercial repositories: Zenodo and OSF. This migration ensures that my work remains transparent, reproducible, and permanently available to the global research community.

## Infrastructure Advocacy

I actively support:

- Non-commercial, community-governed repositories.
- Long-term DOI stability and metadata integrity.
- Transparent governance in Open Science.
- Documenting systemic risks in digital infrastructure to foster more resilient academic solutions.
