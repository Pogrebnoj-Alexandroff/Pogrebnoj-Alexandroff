# Aleksey Pogrebnoj-Alexandroff
### Researcher • Developer • Open Science Advocate

I work at the intersection of research, digital preservation, and open scientific infrastructure.  
My long-term focus is on ensuring that scientific outputs remain accessible, verifiable, and free from commercial lock-in.

## DOI Accessibility Notice

Some of my earlier research outputs were originally deposited on Figshare.  
In 2025, Figshare applied access restrictions to several items, including  
materials with assigned DOIs, despite the fact that these works were originally  
published under open licenses (CC BY 4.0).

These access restrictions were applied unilaterally by Figshare and were not  
related to any violations on my part. As a result, several DOI landing pages  
now lead to inaccessible or empty pages.

To ensure long-term accessibility and compliance with FAIR principles, I have  
migrated my research materials to open, non-commercial repositories such as  
Zenodo and OSF.

This note is provided for transparency, so that readers and collaborators  
understand that the DOI accessibility issues are not caused by any actions  
on my part, but by repository-side access restrictions.

## Open Science and Infrastructure

I actively support:

- non-commercial repositories  
- transparent governance  
- long-term DOI stability  
- community-driven standards  
- reproducibility and public access  

I document systemic issues in open science infrastructure to help researchers  
avoid hidden risks and to encourage more resilient, community-oriented solutions.
