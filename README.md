## 📢 DOI Accessibility & Open Science Statement

> [!IMPORTANT]
> Some of my earlier research outputs were originally deposited on Figshare. In 2025, Figshare unilaterally applied access restrictions to several items—including materials with assigned DOIs—despite these works being published under open licenses (CC BY 4.0).

These restrictions were not caused by any violation of terms or actions on my part. As a result, certain DOI landing pages may appear inaccessible or empty. 

To ensure long-term accessibility and adherence to **FAIR principles**, I migrated my research materials to community-driven, non-commercial repositories such as **Zenodo** and **OSF**. This ensures transparency, reproducibility, and permanent access.

## 🏛️ Infrastructure Advocacy

I actively support:
* Non-commercial, community-governed repositories
* Long-term DOI stability and metadata integrity
* Transparent governance in Open Science
* Documenting systemic risks in digital infrastructure
